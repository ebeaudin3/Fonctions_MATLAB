-- Welcome! --
--------------

Welcome to the Throttle Case Study! This case study demonstrates
 how The MathWorks software enables users to build Integrated
 Measurement Systems, incorporating measurement, analysis, reporting
 and simulation.


-----------------
-- Quick Start --
-----------------

 o Set MATLAB's current directory to the root directory of this case study
 o Type >>demoselector at the MATLAB command line
    - This will open the Demo Selector utility and add all of the 
      directories to the MATLAB path.
 o Run any demos or parts of the case study by double-clicking on the
      appropriate line in the Example Selector utility

-- Documentation Notes --
-------------------------

Please read the documentation.  I spent a lot of time writing it!
 The documentation is a file called 'Throttle Case Study.doc'
 in the Documentation directory.  This (hopefully) covers everything you need
 to know to run this case study.  Key elements of this document:
   o Explanation of hardware and software setups for this case study.
   o Appendix containing details of all included files (organized both
       by directory and presentation order).
   o Detailed procedure for presenting the case study, including speaker's
       notes.

-- Gotchas --
-------------

A few "gotchas" to look out for.
 o If MATLAB does not see your data acquisition hardware, delete the 
     Test Board from Instacal, as explained on page 3.
 o DO NOT RUN any file which is opened in the editor by the example selector.
     If a file is opened, you should walk through the code line-by-line.  
     Suggested scripts for these walkthroughs are included in the documentation.
